Nixeus records and keeps track of your active positions

To have Nixeus start recording your position, use the following format:

        -in [ticker name] [amount of shares] [date]
        
For example, if you started a position in 10 shares of AAPL at $100 per share, you would enter:

        -in AAPL 10 $100
        
To have Nixeus record the exiting of your position, use the following format:

        -out [ticker name] [amount of shares] [date]
        
For example, if you exited a position of 10 shares of AAPL at $150 per share, you would enter:

       -out AAPL 10 $150
